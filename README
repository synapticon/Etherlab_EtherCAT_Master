1) General Information
======================

This is an open-source EtherCAT master implementation for Linux 2.6.

See the FEATURES file for a list of features. For more information, see

2) Requirements
===============

1) Software requirements

Configured sources for the Linux 2.6 kernel are required to build the EtherCAT
master.

2) Hardware requirements

A table of supported hardware can be found at
http://etherlab.org/en/ethercat/hardware.php.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Building and installing
==========================

See the INSTALL file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Realtime & Tuning
====================

Realtime patches for the Linux kernel are supported, but not required. The
realtime processing has to be done by the calling module (see API
documentation). The EtherCAT master code itself is passive (except for the
idle mode and EoE).

To avoid frame timeouts, deactivating DMA access for hard drives is
recommended (hdparm -d0 <DEV>).
